I am currently serving as a research fellow at the National University of Singapore. Before this, I held the position of Senior Lecturer/Lecturer at the Faculty of Information Technology, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, from 2021 to 2022. I earned my PhD degree in 2021 from the National University of Singapore, and I obtained my B.S. degrees in 2013 from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. Following my graduation from University of Moratuwa, I had industry experience as a Software Engineer at Aeturnum Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, Sri Lanka, from 2013 to 2015.

My research focuses on the Security and Privacy of the Internet of Things. I have contributed to top-tier journals and conferences, including publications in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE) and the International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA).
